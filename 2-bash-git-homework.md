### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! 

##### Basic
1. Make sure you have your a `shell` (like `bash`) installed
2. Install `python`, recommended steps can be found here: [Python Setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/). For Windows, Iâ€™d strongly recommend Option 3 (via Installing it through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)) as it will make future steps much easier due to Windows lack of support for the Shell.
3. Complete the [Software Carpentry Unix](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson. Send me a message stating where you stopped.
4. Send me what these command do: 
   `wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n`
   
##### Advanced
1. Complete Software Carpentry Git lesson as best as you can: [Git Novice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Send me a message stating where you stopped.
  
##### Reach
1. Be a `git` master! That is, do the following *from scratch*:
  * create a new repository on Github, with a license and a readme
  * clone it locally
  * create a new text file that contains at least 1 line of text
  * add your file to the repository
  * commit your changes
  * edit the README file that came in the repo in some way
  * commit your changes
  * push your changes to Github
  * send me the url for your Github repository
  
### Optional homework(no need to submit)
* What shell commands we learned are useful for data exploration and why?
* Do a quick research explaining what are the main pros and cons of the Python language.
